    <div id="mario-text-box">Despite being one of the most hated games in the Paper Mario Franchise, Super Paper Mario is one of my favorite games because of its unique gameplay mechanics and great storytelling. It's so hated because its gameplay mechanics are really different from the usual turn-based RPG style of Paper Mario. This game was a platformer where you had the ability to switch to a 3d backview perspective. This allowed the developers to make clever puzzles that required you to switch perspectives. Sometimes, finding the way to progress farther into the stage can be difficult so finding is super rewarding. The writing in the game is really good as well. All of the characters are memorable, and it gives more narrative substance to a Mario game that mainstream Mario games don't really accomplish.</div>
